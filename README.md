# CS-335-Basketball-Game
The goal of the CS 335 final project is to allow students to display their knowledge of OpenGL by creating a basketball shooting game. The game is required to have some basic real time physics, textured objects, a replay functionality, and a user-interface. The game also needs to utilize modern OpenGL practices by using a vertex and fragment shader to render lighting and textures. 

This iteration contains 4 source files, contained within the "src/BasketballGame" folder. The "HelloOpenGL.java" file conains the code to create the game objects and render the scene, as well as handling the physics and mechanics of the game. The "JOGLEventListener.java" file contains the logic for handling the OpenGL event listener, which allows the user-interface to be interactive and handles operations involving the game window. The "lighting.vert" and "lighting.frag" files are the vertex and fragment shader used for lighting the scene using the modern OpenGL shader pipeline. Lastly, the .png files contained in the root of the repository are the textures used by the program.
